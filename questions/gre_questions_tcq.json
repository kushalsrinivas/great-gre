    "answer": [
      "B"
    ],
    "explanation": "Solution\n\nLet us try to understand the meaning of the sentence from the partial information.\n\nThe sentence talks about an element that doesn't justify violence itself but does something to its use. This element is the belief that death, if for a sacred cause, can be considered a proper end of life. The structure and reasoning of the sentence implies that the element is trying to justify the use of violence. In other words, justify can be a good fill-in for the sentence.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the verbs in the options.\n\nA. incriminates – to make (someone) appear guilty of a crime or wrongdoing\nB. valorizes – to give or ascribe value or validity to\nC. indicts – to formally accuse of or charge with a crime\nD. abrogates – to abolish by authoritative action\nE. rescinds – to take away\n\n'Valorizes,' which means to give validity to something, is the correct answer. 'Incriminates,' 'indicts,' and 'abrogates' are opposite to what the context requires. 'Rescinds' does not go with the intended meaning of the sentence.\n\nThe correct answer is B."

      "D"
    ],
    "explanation": "Solution\n\nLet us try to understand the meaning of the sentence from the partial information.\n\nThe sentence discusses rhetoric that was necessary for a traumatized nation but had sobering implications. The word 'necessary' suggests something that was needed, and the phrase 'traumatized nation' indicates the nation was in pain or distress. The word we're looking for should describe something that provides temporary relief or comfort without necessarily solving the root problem, which is suggested by 'sobering implications.'\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the nouns in the options.\n\nA. vassal – a person or country in a subordinate position to another\nB. mien – a person's appearance or manner\nC. decrepitude – the state of being decrepit; worn out or ruined because of age or neglect\nD. palliative – something that makes a problem seem better without actually solving it; a remedy that relieves symptoms without curing\nE. claque – a group of people hired to applaud or heckle a performer\n\n'Palliative,' which means something that provides relief without addressing the underlying cause, is the correct answer. It fits perfectly with the idea of necessary comfort for trauma that still has 'sobering implications.' The other options don't make sense in this context.\n\nThe correct answer is D."

The word 'despite' indicates a contrast - surgeons support something even though evidence doesn't clearly support it. For blank (i), we need a type of treatment that surgeons might advocate. For blank (ii), we need a word that describes how strongly (or not) the studies demonstrate superiority.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the words in the options.\n\nBlank (i):\nA. ameliorative – intended to make something better or improve a bad situation\nB. incipient – in an initial stage; beginning to happen or develop\nC. preemptive – serving or intended to preempt or forestall something; done before something else to prevent it\n\nBlank (ii):\nD. dispassionately – in a way that is not influenced by strong emotion; objectively\nE. unequivocally – in a way that leaves no doubt; unambiguously\nF. intractably – in a way that is hard to control or deal with; stubbornly\n\n'Preemptive' treatment makes sense as something surgeons would advocate - treatment done before a problem fully develops.

    "explanation": "Solution\n\nLet us try to understand the meaning of the sentence from the partial information.\n\nThe sentence states that a country that succeeds in doing something to Pyongyang's missile program of a certain type is safer. The context suggests that the country is taking action to reduce a threat, which would make it safer. For blank (i), we need a word that means reducing or eliminating a threat. For blank (ii), we need a word that describes the nature of the missile program.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the words in the options.\n\nBlank (i):\nA. defanging – removing the fangs from; making harmless or less threatening\nB. denigrating – criticizing unfairly; disparaging\nC. divesting – depriving or ridding of something\n\nBlank (ii):\nD. mellifluous – sweet or musical; pleasant to hear\nE. voluble – speaking or spoken incessantly and fluently; talkative\nF. fledgling – new and inexperienced; just beginning and not yet fully developed\n\n'Defanging' perfectly captures the idea of neutralizing a threat, making it harmless. 'Fledgling' describes a missile program that is in its early stages but potentially dangerous if allowed to develop. Together, these words create a logical sentence: a country that neutralizes a developing missile program becomes safer. 'Denigrating' (criticizing) wouldn't make a country safer, and 'divesting' doesn't fit the context. 'Mellifluous' and 'voluble' don't describe missile programs.\n\nThe correct answer is A and F."

The structure suggests a positive outcome - disease decreased. For blank (i), we need a word describing this positive outcome. For blank (ii), we need a word describing the type of water that was removed (likely contaminated). For blank (iii), we need a word that means the rates decreased.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the words in the options.\n\nBlank (i):\nA. lagniappe – something given as a bonus or extra gift; an unexpected benefit\nB. avarice – extreme greed for wealth or material gain\nC. recidivism – the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend\n\nBlank (ii):\nD. fascistic – relating to or having the characteristics of fascism\nE. fetid – smelling extremely unpleasant; foul-smelling\nF. macabre – disturbing and horrifying because of involvement with death and injury\n\nBlank (iii):\nG. obviate – to remove or prevent (a need or difficulty)\nH. proliferate – to increase rapidly in numbers; multiply\nI. dwindle – to diminish gradually in size, amount, or strength\n\n'Lagniappe' describes an unexpected bonus or benefit, which fits the positive outcome. 'Fetid' describes foul-smelling, contaminated water that would cause disease. 'Dwindle' means to decrease gradually, which describes what happened to disease rates. The other options don't fit: 'avarice' and 'recidivism' are negative concepts unrelated to disease reduction; 'fascistic' and 'macabre' don't describe water quality; 'obviate' and 'proliferate' don't describe rates decreasing.\n\nThe correct answer is A, E, and I."

'Dubious' describes questionable or suspicious confidence men. 'Discommode' means to inconvenience or disturb, and the sentence says this did NOT discommode George, meaning he wasn't bothered by it. The other options don't create a logical sentence: 'incorrigible' and 'peevish' don't specifically relate to deceptiveness; 'flagitious' and 'inscrutable' don't fit the context; 'occlude' and 'tranquilize' don't make sense in the negative construction.\n\nThe correct answer is C, F, and I."

The word 'but' indicates a contrast - the apology seemed sincere but was actually something else. The phrase 'doing little to repair' suggests the apology was superficial or insincere despite its appearance.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the adjectives in the options.\n\nA. trenchant – vigorous or incisive in expression or style; sharp and effective\nB. perfunctory – carried out with a minimum of effort or reflection; done merely as a routine duty\nC. magnanimous – very generous or forgiving, especially toward a rival or less powerful person\nD. solicitous – characterized by or showing interest or concern; attentive\nE. fervent – having or displaying a passionate intensity\n\n'Perfunctory,' which means done without genuine care or effort, is the correct answer.

'Manipulative' describes a deceptive intent to control or influence people. This creates the perfect contrast: a speech that sounds peaceful but is actually designed to manipulate. 'Incendiary' would mean an inflammatory tone (no contrast with negative intent), while 'benign' is close but 'conciliatory' is more specific to speeches.

    "explanation": "Solution\n\nLet us try to understand the meaning of the sentence from the partial information.\n\nThe sentence states that his explanation was so [blank] that it only deepened the confusion. The phrase 'deepened the confusion' indicates that instead of clarifying things, the explanation made them worse. We need a word that describes an explanation that is unclear or difficult to understand.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the adjectives in the options.\n\nA. lucid – expressed clearly; easy to understand\nB. obscure – not discovered or known about; uncertain; not clearly expressed or easily understood\nC. transparent – easy to perceive or detect; obvious\nD. cogent – clear, logical, and convincing\nE. forthright – direct and outspoken; straightforward and honest\n\n'Obscure,' which means unclear or difficult to understand, is the correct answer. An obscure explanation would indeed deepen confusion rather than resolve it. 'Lucid,' 'transparent,' 'cogent,' and 'forthright' all describe clear, understandable explanations that would reduce confusion, not increase it.\n\nThe correct answer is B."
