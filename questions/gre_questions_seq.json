    "explanation": "Solution\n\nLet us try to understand the meaning of the sentence from the partial information.\n\nThe sentence describes Parliament's return on Monday, when senators 'chirped and guffawed their way through' the first autumnal question period. The words 'chirped' (made cheerful sounds) and 'guffawed' (laughed loudly) indicate a lively, energetic, and boisterous atmosphere. We need words that capture this energetic and lively behavior.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the adjectives in the options.\n\nA. lugubrious – looking or sounding sad and dismal; mournful\nB. rambunctious – uncontrollably exuberant; boisterous and noisy\nC. opprobrious – expressing scorn or criticism; abusive\nD. staid – sedate, respectable, and unadventurous; serious and steady\nE. unflagging – tireless; persistent and unremitting\nF. ebullient – cheerful and full of energy; exuberant\n\n'Rambunctious' and 'ebullient' both capture the lively, energetic, and cheerful atmosphere described by senators chirping and guffawing. 'Lugubrious' means sad and mournful, which is the opposite. 'Opprobrious' means abusive or critical, which doesn't fit. 'Staid' means serious and steady, the opposite of the boisterous behavior. 'Unflagging' means tireless but doesn't necessarily convey the cheerful, noisy energy.\n\nThe correct answers are B and F."

    "explanation": "Solution\n\nLet us try to understand the meaning of the sentence from the partial information.\n\nThe sentence states that talk of composite culture is dangerous because it 'tends to weaken national unity' and encourages certain tendencies. The phrase 'weaken national unity' suggests forces that divide or split the nation apart. We need words that describe tendencies toward division, fragmentation, or breaking away from unity.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the adjectives in the options.\n\nA. separatist – advocating or practicing separation, especially from a larger political or religious entity\nB. fissiparous – inclined to cause or undergo division into separate parts or groups; tending to split\nC. portentous – of or like a portent; done in a pompously or overly solemn manner\nD. rapacious – aggressively greedy or grasping; predatory\nE. sycophantic – behaving or done in an obsequious way to gain advantage; fawning\nF. obsequious – obedient or attentive to an excessive or servile degree; excessively eager to please\n\n'Separatist' directly describes tendencies toward separation from the larger entity, which weakens unity. 'Fissiparous' means tending to split or divide, which perfectly captures the tendency to fragment national unity. Both words describe forces that break unity apart. 'Portentous' means ominous or pompous, not divisive. 'Rapacious' means greedy.

The phrase 'live in his shadow' suggests that Bach's greatness was so immense that others couldn't escape or overcome it. We need words that capture the idea of something so powerful or great that it dominates or cannot be surpassed.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the adjectives in the options.\n\nA. insufferable – too extreme to bear; intolerable; unbearably arrogant\nB. overwhelming – very great in amount; overpowering in effect or strength\nC. uncanny – strange or mysterious, especially in an unsettling way\nD. insurmountable – too great to be overcome; impossible to surmount\nE. germane – relevant to a subject under consideration; pertinent\nF. reticent – not revealing one's thoughts or feelings readily; reserved\n\n'Overwhelming' describes something so powerful or great in effect that it dominates everything else, which fits Bach's influence. 'Insurmountable' means impossible to overcome or surpass, which captures why others had to 'live in his shadow.' Both convey the immense, dominating nature of Bach's legacy. 'Insufferable' means intolerable in a negative way. 'Uncanny' means mysterious. 'Germane' means relevant. 'Reticent' means reserved.\n\nThe correct answers are B and D."

The word 'contrasting' suggests conflicting or opposing messages, which would confuse or harm citizens who are trying to understand the situation. We need words that describe how citizens have been negatively affected by these conflicting messages.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the verbs in the options.\n\nA. obviated – removed or prevented (a need or difficulty); made unnecessary\nB. exalted – held in very high regard; elevated in rank or status\nC. evinced – revealed the presence of; showed clearly\nD. whipsawed – subjected to two difficult situations or opposing pressures at the same time; jerked back and forth\nE. impugned – disputed the truth or validity of; called into question\nF. victimized – singled out for cruel or unjust treatment; made a victim of\n\n'Whipsawed' perfectly captures the experience of being pulled back and forth by contrasting or conflicting rhetoric, creating confusion and distress. 'Victimized' describes how citizens have been harmed or made to suffer by this problematic situation. Both words convey the negative impact of contrasting messages on ordinary people.

The phrase 'rich in information' and 'culture as a whole' suggests that this single artifact contains or represents the broader culture in miniature form. We need words that describe something small that represents or embodies a larger whole.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the nouns in the options.\n\nA. microcosms – things regarded as encapsulating in miniature the characteristics of something much larger; small representative systems\nB. antitheses – direct opposites; contrasts\nC. epitomes – perfect examples or embodiments of a quality or type; representative summaries\nD. antipodes – direct opposites or contrasts; places diametrically opposite on the earth\nE. zeniths – the highest points; peaks of achievement\nF. tyros – beginners or novices in learning something\n\n'Microcosms' perfectly describes how a single artifact can represent the larger culture in miniature. 'Epitomes' means perfect examples or embodiments, which captures how the artifact exemplifies aspects of the broader culture. Both words convey the idea of something small representing something larger. 'Antitheses' and 'antipodes' mean opposites, which doesn't fit. 'Zeniths' means peaks.

The word 'but' suggests a qualification or modification to the publication. In contexts involving sensitive information being published, certain details are typically removed, edited, or revised before public release. We need words that describe the process of editing or removing sensitive information.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the nouns in the options.\n\nA. compurgation – an ancient legal practice of clearing someone from a charge by oaths of others\nB. ostentation – pretentious and vulgar display, especially of wealth and luxury\nC. redaction – the process of editing text for publication; removal of sensitive information\nD. recension – a revised edition of a text; critical revision incorporating the best readings\nE. affectation – behavior, speech, or writing that is artificial and designed to impress\nF. repugnance – intense disgust; strong aversion\n\n'Redaction' specifically refers to the editing or removal of sensitive information before publication, which is exactly what would be needed for MP expenses.

The term 'displaced persons' is a mild, diplomatic way of describing people who have lost their homes, families, and entire lives due to war—a much harsher reality. We need words that describe how this mild term was used in place of a more direct or harsh description.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the adverbs in the options.\n\nA. indecorously – in a manner that is not in keeping with good taste and propriety; improperly\nB. snootily – in a manner showing disapproval or contempt toward others; condescendingly\nC. euphemistically – in a way that uses a mild or indirect word or expression in place of one considered to be too harsh or blunt\nD. tenebrously – in a dark, shadowy, or gloomy manner\nE. innocuously – in a harmless or inoffensive manner; not likely to give offense\nF. unabashedly – without embarrassment or shame; boldly\n\n'Euphemistically' describes the use of a mild term ('displaced persons') to soften the harsh reality of people whose lives were destroyed by war. 'Innocuously' means in a harmless or inoffensive way, which captures how the term was chosen to sound less harsh or disturbing. Both words describe how language was softened or made less direct. 'Indecorously' means improperly. 'Snootily' means condescendingly. 'Tenebrously' means gloomily. 'Unabashedly' means boldly.\n\nThe correct answers are C and E."

The word 'but' creates a contrast between his reputation and how he actually appears.

The word 'though' creates a contrast between the newsreader's usual sullen demeanor and today's behavior. Since sullen means gloomy and unfriendly, we need words that are opposite—describing someone friendly, warm, or cheerful.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the adjectives in the options.\n\nA. pragmatic – dealing with things sensibly and realistically; practical\nB. cordial – warm and friendly; showing warmth and friendliness\nC. despondent – in low spirits from loss of hope or courage; dejected\nD. genial – friendly and cheerful; warmly and pleasantly kind\nE. sedulous – showing dedication and diligence; persevering\nF. iconoclastic – attacking or criticizing cherished beliefs or institutions\n\n'Cordial' means warm and friendly, which is the opposite of sullen.

    "question": "According to the youngsters of today’s generation, happiness is __________. So, they believe that it is almost impossible to stay happy for a long time.",
    "options": [
      "A eternal",
      "B evanescent",
      "C impeachable",
      "D ephemeral",
      "E ironical",
      "F paradoxical"

    "answer": [
      "B",
      "D"
    ],
    "explanation": "Solution\n\nLet us try to understand the meaning of the sentence from the partial information.\n\nThe sentence states that according to youngsters, happiness is [blank]. The second sentence provides the key clue: 'So, they believe that it is almost impossible to stay happy for a long time.' This explanation indicates that happiness is short-lived, temporary, or fleeting. We need words that describe something that doesn't last long.\n\nNow, let us look at the meaning of the adjectives in the options.\n\nA. eternal – lasting or existing forever; without end\nB. evanescent – soon passing out of sight, memory, or existence; quickly fading or disappearing\nC. impeachable – able to be charged with misconduct; questionable\nD. ephemeral – lasting for a very short time; transitory\nE. ironical – happening in the opposite way to what is expected; using irony\nF. paradoxical – seemingly absurd or self-contradictory but possibly true\n\n'Evanescent' means quickly fading or disappearing, which explains why happiness is hard to maintain for long. 'Ephemeral' means lasting for a very short time, conveying the same idea of temporary, fleeting happiness. Both words describe something that doesn't last. 'Eternal' means lasting forever (the opposite). 'Impeachable' means questionable. 'Ironical' means contrary to expectations. 'Paradoxical' means contradictory.\n\nThe correct answers are B and D.",
